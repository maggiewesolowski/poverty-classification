# Poverty Classification Project

- Analyzed household and individual-level socioeconomic data to classify households into one of four poverty levels (extreme poverty, moderate poverty, vulnerable households, and non-vulnerable households).

- Cleaned and imputed missing data, ensuring dataset integrity for model development.

- Built a predictive classification model balancing interpretability and predictive power.

- Engineered features, evaluated performance metrics (accuracy, AUC), and provided insights to inform social policy.
